## Overview

`forecasttools-py` is a Python package that supports the CDC's Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics (CFA) Predict division. It provides utilities for:

- **Pre-Processing**: Data retrieval, aggregation, and transformation
- **Post-Processing**: Converting model outputs to Hubverse submission format
- **Validation**: Ensuring forecasts meet hub requirements

## Installation

Install from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/CDCgov/forecasttools-py@main
```

Or with uv:

```bash
uv pip install git+https://github.com/CDCgov/forecasttools-py@main
```

## Quick Start

```python
import forecasttools

# access location data for hub submissions
locations = forecasttools.get_hub_locations("flusight")
print(f"FluSight accepts {len(locations)} locations")

# get standard quantile levels
quantiles = forecasttools.HUBVERSE_QUANTILE_LEVELS
print(f"Hubverse requires {len(quantiles)} quantile levels")

# access pre-packaged datasets
flu_data = forecasttools.nhsn_hosp_flu
print(flu_data.head())
```
